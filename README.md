# 🧠 LeetCode Python Journey

Welcome to my problem-solving journey on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/MOHAMEDHOSSAM2112/)! 
In this repository, I solve problems using **Python**, focusing on mastering algorithms, data structures, and interview patterns.

## 📌 Structure

Each problem is saved in a `.py` file, named exactly like the problem title on LeetCode.  
Inside each file, you'll find:
- ✅ Problem name
- 🔗 LeetCode link
- 📊 Difficulty level
- 💡 My solution (with comments if needed)
- 🛠️ Developer Tools:
You can use `.leetcode-tools/smart_commit.sh` to automatically commit and push new solutions.

Example:

```python
"""
Problem: Two Sum  
LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/  
Difficulty: Easy
"""
# Solution goes here...

```
